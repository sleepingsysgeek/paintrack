# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives â€” PainTrack

## 1. Introduce Pain-Driven Accountability
- Allow users to commit to tasks by "staking" a certain amount of points (virtual or real) as motivation.
- Add emotional and financial consequences to increase task completion rates.
- Create a sense of urgency using psychological triggers like loss aversion.

## 2. Gamify Productivity Without Distraction
- Deliver a minimal, non-gimmicky interface focused on behavioral science.
- Reward successful task completion with point recovery or bonus incentives.
- Avoid unnecessary gamification features that dilute purpose.

## 3. Enable Progress Tracking and Analytics
- Visualize task history, success/failure rates, and behavioral trends.
- Help users reflect on habits and identify productivity patterns.
- Offer insights and recommendations based on task performance.

## 4. Promote Social Accountability
- Let users optionally bet against friends, team members, or public challenges.
- Introduce public or private leaderboards to foster healthy competition.
- Enable peer encouragement or nudges based on activity.

## 5. Design for Freelancers, Solopreneurs, and Students
- Target audiences that thrive on independence but struggle with external accountability.
- Build for solo operators who need help creating structured routines and follow-through.

## 6. Make It Reusable and Scalable
- Architect the app using microservices and modular APIs.
- Ensure it's extensible from an MVP to a full SaaS platform or white-labeled solution.
- Follow clean separation of concerns between services (auth, points, tasks, analytics, etc.).

## 7. Build With a Developer-Friendly Stack
- Use modern and maintainable technologies:
  - **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL
  - **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
  - **Architecture:** Clean Code, OOP Principles, Microservices
- Make the project contributor-friendly from day one.
